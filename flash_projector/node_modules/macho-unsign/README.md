# Overview

A broken code signature is often worse than no signature, so it can be desirable to remove a signature.

This package can remove code signatures from Mach-O binaries.

Both thin and fat binaries are supported.

# Usage

Just pass an `ArrayBuffer` or an object that is a view of an `ArrayBuffer` to the `unsign` function.

If the binary is signed, an unsigned binary in a new `ArrayBuffer` will be returned.

If the binary has no signatures, `null` will be returned.

```js
import {readFile, writeFile} from 'node:fs/promises';
import {unsign} from 'macho-unsign';

const unsigned = unsign(await readFile('macho-binary'));
if (unsigned) {
	console.log('Signature Removed', unsigned);
	await writeFile('macho-binary-unsigned', Buffer.from(unsigned));
} else {
	console.log('Not signed');
}
```
